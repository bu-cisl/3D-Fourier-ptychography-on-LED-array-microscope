# 3D-Fourier-ptychography-on-LED-array-microscope

MATLAB implementation of 3D-Fourier-ptychography-on-LED-array-microscope

### Getting Started

This code is based on the paper "High throughput intensity diffraction tomography with a computational microscope" PDF. It implements closed-form inversion based on Tikhonov regularization to recover 3D phase and absorption from 2D intensity measurements.

### Running the code

MATLAB is required to run this code Run IDT_example.m
